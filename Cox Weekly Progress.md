# Cox — Weekly Progress Log

---

## FP4 — Week 6 | Due: Jun 22
**Deliverable:** Write `config/database.php`: DB connection setup and shared utilities

**Status:** `[ ] Not Started` / `[ ] In Progress` / `[x] Complete`

### What Was Added
- Created `requirement-orchestrator/config/database.php` — PDO singleton with ERRMODE_EXCEPTION, utf8mb4, emulate_prepares off
- Created `requirement-orchestrator/config/.env.example` — documents required environment variables
- Created `.gitignore` — blocks `.env`, `*.local.php`, `.idea/`, `test_db.php`, `vendor/`
- Created full project folder scaffold: `config/`, `src/`, `public/js/`, `sql/`

### Notes
<!-- Add anything relevant: blockers, decisions made, deviations from plan -->

## FP5 — Week 7 | Due: Jun 29
**Deliverable:** Build HTML skeleton of `public/index.php` — Bootstrap 5 split-pane layout with both panel containers; style and wire left chat panel (agent/user bubbles, text input, submit button)

**Status:** `[ ] Not Started` / `[ ] In Progress` / `[x] Complete`

### What Was Added
- `requirement-orchestrator/public/index.php` — Bootstrap 5 split-pane layout. Left panel: scrollable chat stream with agent/user message bubbles, text input, Send button with loading spinner, Enter-key support. Right panel: `#domain-matrix` container with `data-domain` hook structure ready for Port's FP5 badges. JS wires the submit flow (appends bubble, POSTs to `endpoint.php`, graceful fallback until FP9).

### Notes
- Right panel container (`#domain-matrix`) is intentionally empty — Port fills it with 8 `data-domain` badge rows and progress bar in FP5.
- Full AJAX chain (`endpoint.php`) and badge state updates (`app.js`) wired in FP9.
