# Port — Weekly Progress Log

---

## FP4 — Week 6 | Due: Jun 22
**Deliverable:** Write schema migration test — verify tables, UNIQUE token constraint, JSON round-trip in `domain_state`

**Status:** `[ ] Not Started` / `[ ] In Progress` / `[x] Complete`

### What Was Added
- `requirement-orchestrator/tests/schema_migration_test.php` — schema migration test (PHP/PDO). Verifies:
  1. all three core tables exist (`sessions`, `conversation_log`, `domain_state`),
  2. the UNIQUE `session_token` constraint rejects a duplicate insert,
  3. an 8-domain JSON object round-trips through `domain_state` with zero data loss.
- Retrieves the connection via Cox's `config/database.php` (`getDB()`) and applies Jaffer's `config/schema.sql` against an isolated `requirement_orchestrator_test` database (real data never touched). **Result: 12 passed, 0 failed.**

### Notes
- Verified end-to-end against the real teammate files (Cox's `getDB()` + Jaffer's `config/schema.sql`) — integration is demonstrated, not mocked.
- Test is schema-aware of Jaffer's design: children link by numeric `session_id` (FK auto-resolved), token is `CHAR(64)` with a length CHECK, JSON lives in `domain_json`.
- Committed `c6ff71d` and pushed to `main`. Local DB credentials (`config/local.php`) kept gitignored — not committed.
- Run locally: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe tests\schema_migration_test.php` from the `requirement-orchestrator/` folder.
